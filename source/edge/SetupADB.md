title: Setup ADB
---

SDK is compiled in userdebug mode by default. It is conducive to development and debugging.

There are two ways to setup ADB for the OS-Q VIM. The methods portrayed are common with other Android products.

### ADB over Wi-Fi/LAN 
* Ensure that either the Wi-Fi or LAN is connected.
* Enable ADB debugging on your Device: `Settings-->Developer options--->USB debugging`
* Check the IP address of your Device: `Settings-->About device--->Status--->IP`
* Run the `adb connect` command:
```
$ adb connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(IP address)
$ adb root
$ adb connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(IP address)
$ adb remount
```
* Then you can push to debug

### ADB over USB
* Ensure that a USB-C cable is connected between your PC and VIM.
* Enable ADB debugging on your device: `Settings-->Developer options--->USB debugging`
* Open a terminal and type:
```
$ adb shell
```
