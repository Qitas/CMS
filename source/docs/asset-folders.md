## Global Asset Folder

Assets are non-post files in the `source` folder, such as images, CSS or JavaScript files. For instance, If you are only going to have a few images in the Hexo project, then the easiest way is to keep them in a `source/images` directory. Then, you can access them using something like `![](/images/image.jpg)`.
